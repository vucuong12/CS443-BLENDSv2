    "## [Lab 4 (Part I)] BLENDS Node\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lab #4 you will work in BLENDS, a simple cryptocurrency framework we have built for CS443. The BLENDS framework provides an overall architecture with well-defined APIs so that students can focus on core concepts of Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency and do not worry about architecting the system from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The framework makes the following assumptions:\n",
    "* All nodes communicate not directly with each other, but through a broadcast server provided in the framework.\n",
    "* Unless Bitcoin, here a single (priv, pub) key pair is associated with a node.  That is, we equate the concept of a pub key with a node.\n",
    "* We use RSA, instead of ECDSA for public key crypto.\n",
    "* We use SHA-512, instead of SHA-256. You will be using RSASSA-PKCS1_v1_5 of PyCryptodome [Modified on 2018/12/12]\n",
    "* We do not use Merkle tree, but just a simple linked list with hash pointers.\n",
    "* For ease of programming and balance-checking, we use an RDBMS called SQLite to store transactions and blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The broadcast server of the framework does the following:\n",
    "* It works as a communication center by accepting transactions and blocks from a node and broadcasting them to other nodes.\n",
    "* It drops transactions and blocks if they are formatted correctly.\n",
    "* [Under Construction] It runs a leaderboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node in the framework is architected as follows:\n",
    "* It is made up of two processes: main and CLI.\n",
    "* The main process forks a miner thread in order to mine continuously.\n",
    "* The CLI process is the command-line interface for typing in commands to be delivered to the node.  It is given in \"cli.py\".\n",
    "* The CLI process communicates with the main process over HTTP.  \"manager.py\" implements the interface between the CLI and main processes.  This is also given.\n",
    "* The main process is broken into 7 files: blockchain.py, db.py, node.py, crypto.py, miner.py, util.py, and manager.py. util.py and manager.py are given.  For the rest, students will have to fill in the function body given the specification.\n",
